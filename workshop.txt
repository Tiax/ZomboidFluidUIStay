title=Fluid UI Enhancements (FluidUIStay/Transfer Liquid Fixes)
description=For build 42 unstable:
description=Makes the "Transfer Liquids" UI...
description=1) remember where you moved it on screen after closing (this was apparently intended, but is currently still bugged (42.6.0))
description=2) swap left side/right side based on container content: empty container now goes on right (target), non-empty on left (source)
description=3) There's now a button to quickly move the max amount (=slider all the way to the right+transfer).
description=4) Fixes an issue with the progress indicator rendering
description=5) Adds items' icons to the context menu, to make them easier to identify
description=
description=I made this to save my own sanity, because the UI keeps popping up behind my inventory - probably someone else might find this useful.
description=
description=NOTE: I'll hide the mod from the workshop, once it's officially fixed!
