description=For build 42 unstable:
description=Makes the "transfer liquids" UI remember where you moved it on screen after closing.
description=This was apparently intended, but is currently still bugged (42.0.2).
description=I made this to save my own sanity, because the UI keeps popping up behind my inventory - probably someone else might find this useful.
description=NOTE: I'll hide the mod from the workshop, once it's officially fixed!
