# Project Zomboid Mod: Fluid UI Enhancements (FluidUIStay/Transfer Liquid Fixes)

* [Steam Workshop Link](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3390291442)

For build 42 unstable:
Makes the "Transfer Liquids" UI

1) remember where you moved it on screen after closing (this was apparently intended, but is currently still bugged (42.2.0))
2) swap left side/right side based on container content: empty container goes on right now, non-empty on left
3) There's now a button to quickly move the max amount (=slider all the way to the right+transfer).

I made this to save my own sanity, because the UI keeps popping up behind my inventory - probably someone else might find this useful.
